        <h1>Potato Domestication and Types</h1>
        <p>Wild potato species occur from the southern United States to southern Chile.[14] The potato was first domesticated in southern Peru and northwestern Bolivia[15] by pre-Columbian farmers, around Lake Titicaca.[16] Potatoes were domesticated there about 7,000–10,000 years ago from a species in the S. brevicaule complex.</p>
        <p>The earliest archaeologically verified potato tuber remains have been found at the coastal site of Ancon (central Peru), dating to 2500 BC.[18][19] The most widely cultivated variety, Solanum tuberosum tuberosum, is indigenous to the Chiloé Archipelago, and has been cultivated by the local indigenous people since before the Spanish conquest.</p>
