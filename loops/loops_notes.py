# Adelle Ponzoch, Loops Notes in Python

# What is a loop? 
    # a section of code that is going to repeat
# What are the two types of loops?
    #while loop
x = 0
while x < 10:
    print("Hello", x)
    x +=1

    #for loop
nums = [3,5,7,2,8]
for num in nums:
    print(num)
# What is iteration
    #when you do something multiple times, the act of repeating (version)

# What are lists? 
    #a bunch of values in the same variable
siblings = ["Alex", "Katie", "Andrew", "Vienna", "Tori", "Treyson", "Jeff", "Hailey"]
#print one item from the list
print(siblings[3])
#change an item in a list
siblings[7] = "Jake"

#remove item in list
siblings.pop(5)
print(siblings)
#proper list printing with a for loop
for sibling in siblings:
    print(sibling)
# How do you make lists in python? 
    #you make a variable, do brackets and put commas in between list items

# How do you make for loops in python? 

# How do you make while loops in python?
